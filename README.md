# ConvLSTMForGR
## Prerequisites
1) Tensorflow-1.2 <br/>
2) The implementation files of the variants of ConvLSTM are in the local dir "patchs". You need merge them with the corresponding files of TF-1.2. <br/> <br/>
   
## Get the pretrained models
The trained models can be obtained from the below link:  <br/>

## How to use the code
### Prepare the data
1) Convert each video files into images.
2) Replace the path "/ssd/dataset" in the files under "dataset_splits" 
### Training 
1) Use training_*.py to train the networks for different datasets and different modalities. <br/>
### Testing 
1) Use testing_*.py to evaluate the trained networks on the valid or test subsets of Jester or IsoGD. <br/>
